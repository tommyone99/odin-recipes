        <h3>Easy delicious steak for those afraid of groceries going bad</h3>
        <p>I don't buy steak often anymore due to the recent hike in meat prices. But when I do, I want to make sure
            that they never go bad. It's happened a few times before and everytime I cry a little on the inside (sometimes on the outside too).
            I find that the only way to prevent this from happening is to freeze it. For a while, it was always a headache to thaw it out the night before,
            but with this technique, I just need 2-3 hours to get it from frozen to inside my belly.
