    <h3>Simple Chicken Salad for the health conscious</h3>
    <p>If you're anything like Tommy, you're always thinking of creative ways to consume lots of protein in a tasty, healthy, yet frugal fashion.
        This recipe doesn't require a whole lot, contains relatively cheap ingredients, and needs very little preparation. 
        Despite that, a few key ingredients really make this chicken salad pop.
        Personally, I like to put it between lettuce and whole grain bread.
