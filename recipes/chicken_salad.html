    <h3>Simple Chicken Salad for the health conscious</h3>
    <p>If you're anything like Tommy, you're always thinking of creative ways to consume lots of protein in a tasty, healthy, yet frugal fashion.
        This recipe doesn't require a whole lot, contains relatively cheap ingredients, and needs very little preparation. 
        Despite that, a few key ingredients really make this chicken salad pop.
        Personally, I like to put it between lettuce and whole grain bread.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Costco Canned Chicken</li>
        <li>1 Stalk of Celery</li>
        <li>1/2 of a White Onion</li>
        <li>Duke's Mayonaise</li>

        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>(Optional) Walnuts or Almonds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash celery thoroughly and ready your cutting board and a large bowl</li>
        <li>Chop your celery as thin as you can and toss them into your bowl</li>
        <li>Dice your onion half and also throw that into your bowl</li>
        <li>Open your Costco canned chicken and strain all of the juices into the sink</li>
        <li>Toss your chicken into the bowl and add a heaping tablespoon of Duke's mayo as well</li>
        <li>Add in about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and a teaspoon of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Sprinkle tarragon generously</li>
        <li>(Optional) If you have walnuts or almonds, grab a handful, chop them up, and then toss them into the bowl as well</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients together until homogenous *note* you may need to add more mayonaise to ease mixing</li>
        <li>Don't forget to taste when it's all together. Usually there needs to be more salt and pepper as well as vingear</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
