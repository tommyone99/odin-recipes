        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I know what you're thinking. Avocado toast? In this economy? I agree circumstances aren't optimal to be treating yourself,
            however, I assure you that this is a relatively low cost method of consuming such delicacies. When you have it from home, each instance
            of this meal comes out to only about $2-3 in 2023... Let's just hope it stays that way. Anyways, it's super quick to make, healthy, and quite tasty.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Sliced Bread</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
            <li>(Optional) Egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Toss your bread into the toaster</li>
            <li>Slice open your avocado and pit it</li>
            <li>Grab a spoon and scoop out your avocado onto a cutting board</li>
            <li>Take two forks and mash your avocado to your preferred crushed level (I like mine kinda chunky)</li>
            <li>Once the toast pops up, place it on the cutting board and transfer your avocado atop it</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>(Optional) If you'd like to add more substance to this meal, fry and egg sunny side up and place atop the avocado</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
        </ol>
